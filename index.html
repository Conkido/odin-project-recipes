      <li><h2>World´s Best Pancakes</h2>
      <br>
      <p>This vegan pancake recipe is the best of the vegan lot. The secret that these pancakes are not soggy like the other vegans ones is that, it uses custard powder.<br>This ensures the pancakes are cake like and taste and look exactly like non-vegan pancakes. Mix fruit or chocolate chips into the batter if you like. Serve hot with syrup, fresh fruits or jam.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (32 to 38 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>  
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ¾ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil, divided</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Place yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer and add 1 cup warm water and 1 cup flour. Whisk together, then let sit until mixture bubbles and foams, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil and salt into the yeast mixture, followed by 1 3/4 cups flour.<br>Mix at low speed, using a dough hook attachment, until dough is soft, supple, and slightly sticky.<br>If dough sticks to the sides of the bowl, add up to 1/4 cup more flour, a little at a time.
        </li>
        <li>Knead dough with machine on low speed until slightly springy and still soft, 5 to 6 minutes.<br>Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and form into a ball.<br>Wipe inside of bowl with 1/4 teaspoon olive oil. Turn dough around in bowl to cover with a thin film of oil;<br>cover bowl with foil and let sit until dough has doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove dough from bowl and place onto a floured work surface. Lightly pat into a flat shape about 1-inch thick. Use a knife to cut dough into 8 equal pieces.<br>Form each piece into a small round ball with a smooth top, pulling dough from the sides and tucking the ends underneath the bottom.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough balls to a lightly floured work surface and sprinkle the tops with flour.<br>One at a time, gently pat the dough with your fingers, forming a flat, round bread about 1/4-inch thick. Let the shaped dough rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Brush a cast iron skillet with remaining 3/4 teaspoon olive oil and place over medium-high heat.<br>Lay dough into the hot skillet; cook until puffy and the bottom has brown spots and blisters, about 3 minutes. </li>
        <li>Flip, cook 2 more minutes, and flip back onto original side to cook for about 30 more seconds.<br>Pita bread will begin to puff up and fill with hot air.</li>
        <li>Stack cooked breads on a plate; when cool enough to handle,<br>slice breads in half and open the pocket inside for stuffing. Enjoy them warm!
